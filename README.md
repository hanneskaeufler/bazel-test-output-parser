# bazel-test-output-parser

This solely exists to work around https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/14648.
In an ideal world I would've implemented a change in bazel itself to fix the issue,
but then again the bazel source is tough to dive into and I wanted to learn Rust
anyway and be able to cross compile from macOS to windows and ubuntu linux.
